## ✅ Impact

Mental health support for students under academic stress is extremely important. While academic pressure is a factor, it is not the sole cause of suicidal thoughts. This project does not account for other key stressors such as social relationships, personal struggles, or access to mental health resources. A potential risk is that the results may be misinterpreted to dismiss or minimize the experiences of students facing severe academic or emotional challenges. Our goal is to contribute to a better understanding—not oversimplify the issue.
